    <p style="font-weight:bold" align="center">Improving tracability of Debian packages

    <p style="font-weight:bold" align="center">A mechanism to register
    build-time informations inside a Debian package.  Mostly, that
    means keeping a list of the versions of all packages used for the
    package build.

    <p>You may be looking for <a
    href="http://people.debian.org/~dirson/buildinfo/" >available
    build informations</a>.
    
    <p>Note: the latest version of this document can be found at <a
    href="http://ydirson.free.fr/en/software/buildinfo.html"
    >http://ydirson.free.fr/en/software/buildinfo.html</a>.

    <p>Note: this is currently a work-in-progress thing.  It needs to
    be used by a couple of people willing to send feedback, before
    thinking about promoting it to a standard Debian tool.

    <h2>How is it useful ?</h2>

    <p>When I talk about this tool to encourage people to give me
    feedback, I often get "I don't understand its usefulness" as
    answer.  Here is a try to clarify why I think it's useful.
    Please, do tell me if you feel these explanations do not convince
    you :)

    <dl>
      <dt>Finding out that a package needs rebuild
	
      <dd>What makes a binary package is a combination of the source
      package <em>AND</em> build-dependencies.  Since library APIs are
      subject to change and bugs get fixed (in compilers, libs, etc),
      a package which used to build may start to
      FTBFS at any time because of a new version of a
      build-dependency, as recently demonstrated by the transition
      from gcc 3.2 to gcc 3.3.

	<p>It also sometimes occur that bugs in build-deps cause
	subtle problems in packages built with it.  Debhelper comes to
	mind, as it eveolves quickly and is used by many packages.
	Being able to locate packages built with a known-broken
	version of a package will greatly help to improve the quality
	of Debian.
	
      <p>The current way of distributing binary packages of GPL'd
      software may even be read as a violation of the spirit of the
      GPL, in that it may not be possible to rebuild the binary
      package from stuff available from Debian.
      
      <p>This information can be used to provide a mechanism that will
      check whether a build-dep requires a package to be rebuilt.
      This probably requires that:
	<ul>
	  <li>packages declare whether a new version possibly requires
	    depending packages to be rebuilt
	  <li>packages may declare that some (build-)essential
	    packages are to be ignored in this calculation
	</ul>
      </dd>

      <dt>Blame a build-dep/build-essential/essential package for a
      buildd failure
	
      <dd>When a package fails to autobuild, the only version
      information we get is that of packages that were not already
      installed on the build daemon.  This excludes the toolchain,
      although recent buildd versions now print this particular set of
      version numbers, and other stuff.  And the information in the
      buildd logs is not systematically parsable, it is mostly meant
      for the human eye.

      <p>An idea from Rene Engelhard is to have dh_buildinfo invoked
      from the very beginning of the build process (before
      <tt>./configure</tt> or any other thing that could possibly
      fail), and to cat the output so that the information is
      available from the buildd logs in case of build failure.  This
      could surely be improved by adding knowledge of the buildinfo to
      buildd itself.  For now you can achieve this by calling
      <tt>dh_buildinfo generate cat</tt> before <tt>./configure</tt>
      is run, and then <tt>dh_buildinfo install</tt> to install the
      already-generated <tt>debian/buildinfo</tt> into your packages.

      <dt>Quick summaries
	
      <dd>This info can be used to generate nifty graphs.  Everyone
      likes nifty graphs.  And tables too :)
      <ul>
	<li>For each package, a table showing for each arch the
	version of a build-dep, and the current version thereof.
	Maybe with some colors to better visualize outdated stuff.
	
	<li>For each package, a graph of the number of packages built
	using each version thereof.  With some history to visualize
	transitions.  And take all archs into account.
      </ul>
    </dl>

    <h2>What currently exists</h2>

    <p>See package <a href="http://packages.debian.org/dh-buildinfo"
    >dh-buildinfo</a> in sarge and later.  It contains:

    <ul>
      <li>A dh_buildinfo
      script, which generates a <tt>buildinfo</tt> file, which
      currently ends up being installed into each package's doc
      directory.  These info currently contain the versions of all
      packages on which the package build-depends, as well as
      build-essential and essential packages.  It is at least
      limited in that:
	<ul>
	  <li>Virtual packages are not 100% correctly listed I think
	  <li>Build-Depends-Indep is not handled correctly
	</ul>

      <li>The BuildDeps perl module which abstracts the core
      functionality of <tt>dpkg-checkbuilddeps</tt>.

    </ul>
    
    <h2>How to use this info</h2>

    <p>Running <tt>grep '^[^ ]'</tt> on a buildinfo file will extract
    all lines with a package and its version.  All lines starting with
    a space can be considered as "human use only".

    <h2>Bugs/plans/ideas for the future</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>See if we can improve the structure of the buildinfo file,
      to make it more easily parsable.

      <li>We could get rid of the runtime-dependency on
      <tt>build-essential</tt>
      
      <li>See where the generated information should be
      per-binary-package or per-set-of-binary-packages, where it
      should be located (in the filesystem (in
      <tt>/usr/share/doc/<em>package</em>/buildinfo</tt>, or
      <tt>/usr/share/buildinfo/<em>package</em></tt>, or whatever),
      but that will cause diskpace problems, as an additional
      file to be uploaded (to register in <tt>debian/files</tt>), in
      the deb at the same level as data.tar.gz (eg. added with <tt>ar
      q foo.deb buildinfo</tt>), just registered on buildd.d.o (<a
      href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2001/debian-devel-200110/msg01997.html"
      >suggested by aj</a>), etc.)
      
      <li>Better handling of alternatives and virtual packages:
      <ul>
	<li>See example below
	<li>Correctly handle virtual packages when computing closure
	<li>Warn for virtual packages multiply provided
	<li>Maybe query alternatives on multiply provided packages (eg. awk)
      </ul>

      <li>Better handling of arch-indep packages and build-deps:
      <ul>
	<li>Correctly handle <tt>Build-Depends-Indep</tt>
	<li>Omit packages which we know have no influence on an
	arch-indep package ?  Or is it too much of an hypothesis
	(think of an arch-indep package with data produced by a
	program compiled at build-time) ?
      </ul>
      
      <li>Write an efficient pool-traversal lib (or check whether
      there is already one), to extract the buildinfo from binary
      packages.

      <li>Have this mechanism accepted and used

      <li>World domination
    </ul>

    <h2>Sample output</h2>

    <p>This is a buildinfo file for gcompris 3.2-3 [2003/08/07]

    <p>You will notice the 2 available alternatives for the "awk"
    virtual package (not nice, eh...)
