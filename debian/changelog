dh-buildinfo (0.11+nmu2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Replace call to Dh_Lib::buildarch() with Dh_Lib::hostarch() to
    avoid a deprecation warning.  Thanks to Clint Adams for the
    patch.  (Closes: #882334)
  * Replace manual uses of install(1) with debhelper's install_dir
    and install_file.  They are faster and support "Rules-Requires-Root"
    out of the box.  Thanks to Clint Adams for the patch.
    (Closes: #881421)
  * Add the (now) mandatory "build-arch" and "build-indep" targets
    (plus add "install-arch" and "install-indep" for consistency).
  * Set "Rules-Requires-Root: no" as dh-buildinfo does not require
    (fake)root to build (after the above changes).

dh-buildinfo (0.11) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Avoid dups in "pulled by" lines, and sort contents of those for output
    stability.
  * Ignore packages of foreign architecture, we were mistakely adding a line for them
  * Mark as "Multi-Arch: foreign" to ease cross-compilation (From Colin
    Watson @ Ubuntu, Closes: #728203)
  * Include manpage contributed by Luis Rodrigo Gallardo Cruz (Closes: #203410).
    Adjusted Makefile.PL to make any changes to debian/rules useless.

dh-buildinfo (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Acknowledge NMU.
  * Include in source the lastest buildinfo-packagetable version, with
    more flexible command line.
  * Produce stable output (Jérémy Bobbio, Closes: #722186):
    * sort list of packages
    * omit original name/timestamp from gzip file
  * Don't install buildinfo files inside udebs (Colin Watson, Closes: #593601).
  * Move debhelper from Build-Depends-Indep to Build-Depends (lintian).
  * Use DESTDIR instead of PREFIX at "make install" time (lintian).
  * Don't ignore all "make realclean" errors (lintian).
  * Switch from debhelper compat 4 to 9.
  * Switch from dh_clean -k to dh_prep.

dh-buildinfo (0.9+nmu1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Add architecture to buildinfo file name. (closes: #620104)

 -- Bastian Blank <waldi@debian.org>  Sun, 13 May 2012 09:53:56 +0000

dh-buildinfo (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Corrected Makefile.PL and debian/rules to get a sane install procedure
    (Closes: #352787).

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Tue, 14 Feb 2006 22:20:38 +0100

dh-buildinfo (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix from Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a:
    * Use /usr/share/build-essential/ instead of /usr/share/doc/build-essential for
      location of 'list' and 'essential-package-list'. This 
      avoids depending on stuff in /usr/share/doc/ which violates policy (Closes: #225334)
    * Adjusted depends line since only version 7 and above of build-essential
      provided both files at /usr/share/build-essential/
  * Also adjusted build-depends for this.

dh-buildinfo (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Compress buildinfo file on installation instead of relying on other
    programs to do that, since several packages have an uncompressed
    buildinfo file already.  
  * New stat: number of stored buildinfo files.
  * Fixed call of fetchinfo script so that it gets effectively run in the
    cron job.
  * Fixed stat scripts not to be confused by regexp metacharacters in
    package names and version numbers (esp. `+' was causing much trouble.

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Wed, 17 Sep 2003 09:32:59 +0200

dh-buildinfo (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now accepts optional command-line arguments "generate", "install", and
    "cat", defaulting to "generate install" to emulate previous behaviour.  
  * Get rid of too-strict perl builddep (Jerome Warnier).
  * Include stats scripts in source package.
  * Updated doc to point to daily-generated graph showing the use of this
    package.
  * Moved TODO items from script source to HTML doc.

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Fri,  8 Aug 2003 22:53:47 +0200

dh-buildinfo (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made all header lines start with a space, so that a simple grep can be
    used to extract the whole list.

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Thu, 17 Jul 2003 00:06:04 +0200

dh-buildinfo (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added build-essential to build-deps, and temporarily added it to deps
    as well, until I include some pre-parsed version of the lists in
    there, into the package (Closes: #201473).

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Wed, 16 Jul 2003 17:42:46 +0200

dh-buildinfo (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Put the buildinfo.html webpage in the package, after updating the TODO
    list inside.

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Mon,  7 Jul 2003 23:41:14 +0200

dh-buildinfo (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed package section from perl to devel.

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Mon,  7 Jul 2003 11:59:59 +0200

dh-buildinfo (0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial package (state of the code I wrote in october 2001).
